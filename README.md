By determining the order of the questions in a survey. The survey pages for the respondents will be mobile first optimized. The entire system will have visual feedback and instructions for the functionalities that are specific to a user of the web app.

## Installation
### How to Run the Web App:
* Clone/Downlaod the project

* Remove node_modules folder

* Check package.json to see all the required frameworks

* Run "npm install" command

* Install client dependencies for mongoose database to run the app and connect to local database

* Other Way just using these commands: Install $project by running: git clone https://github.com/beavinash/surveyfy.git cd surveyfy rm -r npm node_moudles npm install

* Installing MongoDB on a Cloud9 workspace sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org

* $ mkdir data $ echo 'mongod --bind_ip=$IP --dbpath=data --nojournal --rest "$@"' > mongod $ chmod a+x mongod

* $ ./mongod

### How to Run Tests:

* Note: The commands work based on your directory/workspace structure. So, use 'cd' command appropriately to navigate directory structure

* Use 'cd' command from root directory to move to another directory i.e. cd tests/

Run test:

* Once you are in tests/ folder run i.e. mocha user.test.js in command/terminal

* Similarly, test for other cases using i.e. mocha option.test.js (example)

### Mocha:

* Mocha, a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js has been used to write test cases for the project. Asynchronous testing is done. Tests are run serially.

* Mocha utilizes a library called "Chai"

## Server Information
Surveyfy has been currently deployed on “Heroku” Web Server.
## Deployment Procedure:
* Login into “Heroku” account and prompts are followed to create a new SSH Public Key $ heroku login •	Clone the project repository to the local machine Example: $ heroku git:clone https://github.com/beavinash/surveyfy.git •	Change directory into the root directory of the cloned project. $ cd Surveyfy

* Use the following command to install required dependencies for the Surveyfy project $ npm install

* If any changes are made to the project repository, use the following git commands to save and deploy to the production server. $ git add . $ git commit -am "make it better" $ git push heroku master

# Coding Standard:
Google, ESLint coding standard has been used. Semicolon (;) in this entire project is not required at the end of each line hence semicolon not used.
